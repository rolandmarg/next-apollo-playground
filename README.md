## next-apollo-playground

nextjs is cool right? it offers ssr and ssg, great developer experience and nice docs

typescript is cool to, makes you more confident in your code and gives autocomplete

apollo is graphql deluxe package, with its server and client, managing state, writing queries and caching is premium experience

graphgql-code-generator is a godsend, autogenerates typescript types from gql operations. Using graphql + typescript + garphql-code-generator is orgasmic developer experience.

next-auth is a library which does oauth2 authentication for serverless environment.

As a standalone libraries/frameworks they are all good, but god are they introducing complexity for a little project
